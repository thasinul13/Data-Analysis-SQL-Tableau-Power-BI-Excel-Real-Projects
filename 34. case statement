WHAT THIS QUERY IS DOING — SUPER EASY EXPLANATION
1. It categorises customers into income groups

Based on their creditLimit, SQL puts each customer into a group:

If creditLimit < 75k → Group A

If 75k–100k → Group B

If 100k–150k → Group C

If >150k → Group D

Otherwise → "Other"

This is exactly like labeling buckets.
