Before the questions – mental model

You’re working with (classicmodels):

customers table → has things like
customerNumber, customerName, maybe contactFirstName, contactLastName

orders table → has
orderNumber, orderDate, status, customerNumber

Key:
customerNumber is the link between both tables.
That’s what you’ll join on.

General join skeleton:

SELECT  ...columns you want...
FROM    customers AS c
JOIN    orders AS o
   ON   c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber;


You’ll only change:

which JOIN type (INNER / LEFT)

which columns you SELECT

Q1

Show the customer first name, last name, orderdate and status for each order in the orders table with a matching customer in the customer table.

Think step-by-step:

Which table has the name?
→ customers

Which table has orderDate & status?
→ orders

“for each order … with a matching customer”

That means: only orders that actually have a customer.

If the order had no matching customer, we don’t care.

This is the classic INNER JOIN situation.

So structure:

SELECT  c.????, c.????, o.????, o.????   -- fill these
FROM    customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o
   ON   c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber;


👉 Your job now:

Replace the ???? with the correct column names for:

first name

last name

order date

status

Run it and see if it matches the question text.

Q2

Display the first name and last name of all customers, and the order date and ordernumber of all their orders, even if the customer made no orders.

Again:

Columns:

Names → customers

orderDate, orderNumber → orders

“all customers … even if the customer made no orders”

That means customers who don’t have matching orders must still appear.

This is a LEFT JOIN with customers on the left.

Skeleton:

SELECT  c.????, c.????, o.????, o.????   -- fill
FROM    customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o
   ON   c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber;


If a customer has no orders, the orderDate and orderNumber will show as NULL, but the customer still appears — exactly what the question asks.

How you can practice (no memorising, just patterns)

For every word in the question, map it to SQL:

“all customers” → customers is the main (left) table

“even if … no orders” → LEFT JOIN

“with a matching …” → INNER JOIN

Always write this 4-line skeleton first:

SELECT ...
FROM   table1 alias1
JOIN   table2 alias2
   ON  alias1.key = alias2.key;


Then just:

choose JOIN type (INNER/LEFT)

fill column names in SELECT
